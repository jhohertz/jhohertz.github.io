With the new feature for doing slide decks in the latest release of [Dr. Henry](https://github.com/jhohertz/dr-henry), I'm moving my [slides on NetflixOSS](http://jhohertz.github.io/netflixoss-slides/) to a [new location here](http://jhohertz.github.io/slides/netflixoss/), and publishing a now probably a bit-dated set on [Google publisher tag insertion](http://jhohertz.github.io/slides/gpt-tags/) from August 2013. 

More decks to come. And some kind of index to find them, which is the next direction for Dr. Henry, to get navigation/flow improvements, better control over it, more uniform handling between themes, and so on.

If you want to know more about how simple deck authoring is with the templating now in Dr. Henry is, check out the [release note for version 0.1.1](http://jhohertz.github.io/dr-henry/blog/2014/07/15/release-0.1.1-tagged-with-social-fixes-and-slide-deck-layout-based-on-reveal.js/)
