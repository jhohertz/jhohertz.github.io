# The production_url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt 
# Most places will/should use root_url to make the urls
# Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{ root_url }}
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.io, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.
